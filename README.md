## 🚀 Features

✅ **Smart Contract-Based Donations**  
All donations are handled through Ethereum smart contracts ensuring that every transaction is transparent, tamper-proof, and immutable.

✅ **Real-Time Blockchain Verification**  
Every donation is stored on-chain, allowing anyone to verify where the funds are going in real time.

✅ **Public Audit Logs**  
Transaction records are viewable directly through a blockchain explorer or the app's transaction dashboard.

✅ **Admin & User Portals**  
- **Donors**: Donate, view past transactions, and download receipts.
- **Admins/NGOs**: Create campaigns, manage funds, and access analytics.

✅ **Security First**  
Smart contracts follow Solidity best practices and are tested for reentrancy, overflow, and access control vulnerabilities.

✅ **Future Plans**  
- Add multi-chain support (Polygon, BNB)
- Anonymous donation mode (via zk-SNARKs)
- Integration with real-time aid reporting from NGOs
