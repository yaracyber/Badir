Our Technology Stack
Built with cutting-edge blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in every donation.

How Does Blockchain Work?

Watch this video to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how it powers our donation platform.

How Does the Blockchain Work? (Step-by-Step)
1. Many Participants
A blockchain is a network of many computers (nodes) around the world. Each has a copy of the same data.

2. Transactions Form Blocks
When someone donates, the transaction is grouped with others into a "block." Each block contains a list of recent transactions.

3. Blocks Are Linked
Each new block is linked to the previous one, forming a secure "chain" that can't be changed or tampered with.

4. Everyone Verifies
All nodes check and agree on the new block. If most agree, the block is added to the chain and the data is permanent.

5. Anyone Can Audit
Because the blockchain is public, anyone can check the donation records for transparency and trust.

Smart Contract Features
Security
Advanced encryption and secure processing for every transaction.

Transparency
Complete visibility into all donation transactions.

Automation
Smart contracts execute automatically without intermediaries.

Tracking
Real-time monitoring of all donation activities.

How Smart Contracts Work
1
Code Creation
Smart contract rules are written in code, like a digital recipe that must be followed exactly.

2
Deployment
The contract is deployed to the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent.

3
Execution
When conditions are met, the contract automatically executes without human intervention.

4
Verification
All actions are recorded on the blockchain for permanent verification.

Key Benefits
Trust & Transparency
Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent record of all donations. This builds trust between donors and recipients.

Security & Reliability
Advanced cryptography and decentralized verification ensure that all transactions are secure and cannot be altered or tampered with.

Efficiency & Cost-Effectiveness
By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes, we reduce costs and ensure more of your donation goes directly to the cause.
